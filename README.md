# Ritsumeikan University food truck finder (babi)
The goal of our project was to create a website that is able to tell the location of all of the food stalls available in Ritsumeikan University BKC campus based on the day. We provide the users with a calendar that they can choose to see which food stalls are available in that day or the day after with the exact position showed in the map.
